        <p>blaplay - a bla that plays (or: a working title that stuck)</p>

<p>blaplay is an audio player for GNU/Linux with a minimalist design approach
rather than feature richness. It is written in Python 2.6, and relies on PyGTK,
PyGST, and Mutagen to implement its core functionality. Notable features
include a monitored audio library, automatic cover art, lyrics and biography
fetching, and last.fm scrobbling. In addition to that it offers event and
release recommendations based on the user's last.fm library, as well as support
for internet radio streams.</p>

<p>Refer to the TODO file for more details on planned features/enhancements, and
the BUGS file for a description of currently known issues and proposed possible
solutions.</p>

<p>Build dependencies:</p>

<ul>
<li>python-dev (&gt;= 2.6)</li>
<li>Cython (&gt;= 0.15.1)</li>
<li>python-numpy</li>
<li>libfftw3-dev (&gt;= 3.2.2)</li>
</ul><p>Runtime dependencies:</p>

<ul>
<li>python (&gt;= 2.6)</li>
<li>python-gtk2 (&gt;= 2.21)</li>
<li>python-gst0.10</li>
<li>python-mutagen (&gt;= 1.19)</li>
<li>python-gobject (&gt;= 2.21)</li>
<li>libfftw3-3 (&gt;= 3.2.2)</li>
</ul><p>Recommended:</p>

<ul>
<li>gstreamer0.10-plugins-good</li>
<li>gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad</li>
<li>gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly</li>
<li>python-mmkeys</li>
<li>python-dbus (&gt;= 0.83)</li>
</ul><p>blaplay currently includes visualization elements which, for performance
reasons, are written in Cython, wrapping fftw3 in order to transfer the most
computationally expensive operations to C-code. Building blaplay therefore
requires a recent version of the Cython compiler (&gt;= 0.15.1), as well as the
single-precision library of fftw3 and its development headers. To prepare and
run blaplay locally, issue</p>

  <span class="nv">$ </span>./blaplay.py

<p>after satisfying all build-dependencies. To install blaplay system-wide and run
it, simply issue</p>
