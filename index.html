        <p>blaplay - a bla that plays (or: a working title that stuck)</p>

<p>blaplay is an audio player for GNU/Linux with a minimalistic design focus
rather than feature richness. As a consequence a plugin system is neither
implemented nor planned for the future. Instead new features that are decided
to be added will be implemented into the core application. blaplay is written
in Python 2.6, and relies on PyGTK, PyGST, and Mutagen to implement its basic
functionality. Notable features include a monitored audio library, automatic
cover art, lyrics and biography fetching, and last.fm scrobbling. In the future
blaplay will also integrate event, artist and release recommendations (powered
by last.fm, musicbrainz and, songkick), as well as support for internet radio
stations and portable media devices. Refer to the TODO file for more details on
planned features/enhancements. The BUGS file contains a description of
currently known issues and proposed possible solutions.</p>

<p>Build dependencies:</p>

<ul>
<li>python-dev (&gt;= 2.6)</li>
<li>Cython (&gt;= 0.15.1)</li>
<li>python-numpy</li>
<li>libfftw3-dev (&gt;= 3.2.2)</li>

<li>python-gtk2 (&gt;= 2.21)</li>
<li>python-gst0.10</li>
<li>python-mutagen (&gt;= 1.19)</li>
<li>python-gobject (&gt;= 2.21)</li>

<li>gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly</li>
<li>python-mmkeys</li>
<li>python-dbus (&gt;= 0.83)</li>
</ul><p>blaplay currently includes a spectrum analyzer element which, for performance
reasons, is written in Cython, wrapping fftw3 in order to transfer the most
computationally expensive operations to C-code. Building blaplay therefore
requires a recent version of the Cython compiler (&gt;= 0.15.1), as well as the
single-precision library of fftw3 and its development headers. To prepare and
run blaplay locally, issue</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>  <span class="nv">$ </span>./setup.py build_ext --inplace
  <span class="nv">$ </span>./blaplay.py
</pre></div>

<p>after satisfying all build-dependencies. To install blaplay system-wide and run
it, simply issue</p>
