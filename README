blaplay - a bla that plays (or: a working title that stuck)

blaplay is an audio player for GNU/Linux with a minimalistic design approach
rather than feature richness. It is written in Python 2.6, and relies on PyGTK,
PyGST, and Mutagen to implement its core functionality. Notable features
include a monitored audio library, automatic cover art, lyrics and biography
fetching, and last.fm scrobbling. In addition to that it offers event and
release recommendations based on the user's last.fm library, as well as support
for internet radio streams.

Refer to the TODO file for more details on planned features/enhancements, and
the BUGS file for a description of currently known issues and possible
solutions. Below is a list of dependencies and recommended packages.
Considering the heterogeneity of Linux distributions and package naming
conventions we only list Debian package names.

Build dependencies:
    * python-dev (>= 2.6)
    * Cython (>= 0.15.1)
    * python-numpy
    * libfftw3-dev (>= 3.2.2)

Runtime dependencies:
    * python (>= 2.6)
    * python-gtk2 (>= 2.21)
    * python-gst0.10
    * python-mutagen (>= 1.19)
    * python-gobject (>= 2.21)
    * libfftw3-3 (>= 3.2.2)

Recommended:
    * gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
    * gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
    * gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
    * python-mmkeys
    * python-dbus (>= 0.83)

blaplay currently includes visualization elements which, for performance
reasons, are written in Cython, wrapping fftw3 in order to transfer the most
computationally expensive operations to C-code. Building blaplay therefore
requires a recent version of the Cython compiler (>= 0.15.1), as well as the
single-precision library of fftw3 and its development headers. To prepare and
run blaplay locally, issue
  $ ./setup.py build_ext --inplace
  $ ./blaplay.py

after having satisfied all build dependencies. To install blaplay system-wide
and run it, simply issue
  $ ./setup.py install
  $ blaplay

Note that the first line of script executables now reads:
#!/usr/bin/env python2
This conforms to the way Arch Linux treats different Python versions nowaydays:
python2 is symlinked to either python2.6 or python2.7, whereas python
symlinks to python3.
