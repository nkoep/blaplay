blaplay - a bla that plays (or: a working title that stuck)

blaplay is an audio player for GNU/Linux with a minimalistic design focus
rather than feature richness. As a consequence a plugin system is neither
implemented nor planned for the future. Instead new features that are decided
to be added will be implemented into the core application. blaplay is written
in Python 2.6, and relies on PyGTK, PyGST, and Mutagen to implement its basic
functionality. Notable features include a monitored audio library, automatic
cover art, lyrics and biography fetching, as well as last.fm scrobbling. In
addition to that it offers event and release recommendations based on the
user's last.fm library.

In the future blaplay will also integrate support for internet radio stations
and portable media devices. Refer to the TODO file for more details on
planned features/enhancements. The BUGS file contains a description of
currently known issues and proposed solutions.

Build dependencies:
    * python-dev (>= 2.6)
    * Cython (>= 0.15.1)
    * python-numpy
    * libfftw3-dev (>= 3.2.2)

Runtime dependencies:
    * python (>= 2.6)
    * python-gtk2 (>= 2.21)
    * python-gst0.10
    * python-mutagen (>= 1.19)
    * python-gobject (>= 2.21)
    * libfftw3-3 (>= 3.2.2)

Recommended:
    * gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
    * gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
    * gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
    * python-mmkeys
    * python-dbus (>= 0.83)

blaplay currently includes a spectrum analyzer element which, for performance
reasons, is written in Cython, wrapping fftw3 in order to transfer the most
computationally expensive operations to C-code. Building blaplay therefore
requires a recent version of the Cython compiler (>= 0.15.1), as well as the
single-precision library of fftw3 and its development headers. To prepare and
run blaplay locally, issue
  $ ./setup.py build_ext --inplace
  $ ./blaplay.py

after satisfying all build-dependencies. To install blaplay system-wide and run
it, simply issue
  $ ./setup.py install
  $ blaplay
