Short-term:
- store tag values as list instead of strings joined by "\n"
- enhance command-line interface
- enhance tag editor (parse tags from filename)
- get a proper logo
- write up some crude unit/regression tests
- improve internet radio support (cf. blaplay/blagui/blaradio.py)
- improve lyrics fetcher (more robust search, more search engines)
- lower memory footprint
- improve/speed up "remove duplicates" functionality and extend the feature to
  the queue as well
- improve startup speed/reduce import overhead
- implement shuffle albums/repeat album playback modes
- implement peeking (tooltips for previous/next/random buttons showing which
  track would be played if button was clicked)
- iPod support, possibly other players, too
- support for CUE sheets
- gapless playback
- get covers from covertartarchive/musicbrainz if they're not on last.fm
- add spectrogram (+ 3D spectrogram) visualization(s) if feasible

Long-term:
- QTableView clone in GTK to allow cells to span across multiple columns
  (required for grouping in playlists)
- port to GI once stability/performance is satisfying
- py3k port once all required modules are ported (the main requirement
  being mutagen as Gtk and Gst won't be a problem once we ported to GI)
