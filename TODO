0.2:
- add acoustid support
- add video support
- add compact interface
- add musicbrainz-ngs support (mainly for the lyrics (wikia) and cover
  (coverartarchive.org) fetchers)
- add iPod support, possibly other players, too
- support for CUE sheets
- gapless playback
- conform to the MPRIS specifications as defined by freedesktop.org and use
  the exposed interfaces for respective CLI invocations
- get covers from covertartarchive/musicbrainz if they're not on last.fm
- implement shuffle albums/repeat album playback modes
- implement peeking (tooltips for previous/next/random buttons showing which
  track would be played if button was clicked)
- write up base class for visualization elements which exposes generic methods
  for calculating FFT, channel mean, etc.
- add spectrogram (+ 3D spectrogram) visualization(s) if feasible
- parse tags from filename/rename files from tags
- write up some crude unit/regression tests
- capture button 4 and 5 events to go to the next/previous song in a playlist
- test if it's feasible to drop the mutagen dependency in favor of
  GstDiscoverer/GstTagSetter. mutagen is currently the only module we use that
  is not available for py3k yet
- add customizable paned view to playlists

0.3+:
- restore closed playlists
- lower memory footprint
- improve startup speed/reduce import overhead
- port to GI once stability/performance is satisfying
- py3k port once all required modules are ported (the main requirement
  being mutagen as Gtk and Gst won't be a problem once we ported to GI)
