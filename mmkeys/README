Multimedia Key support as a PyGTK object
----------------------------------------
This module lets you access multimedia keys found on most new keyboards
from Python; most important it grabs all input events so your program
doesn't need to be in focus when the key is pressed (which is the
usual behavior of the keys). You still need something like Acme or
xmodmap to map the keys before using them.

This code comes from the mmkeys object found in the Muine media player.

Compiling:
----------
(Requires the PyGTK and Python development libraries.)
$ make mmkeys.so

Usage:
------
import mmkeys
keys = mmkeys.Mmkeys()
keys.connect("mm_prev", previous_cb)
keys.connect("mm_next", next_cb)
keys.connect("mm_playpause", playpause_cb)

Make sure the reference to 'keys' sticks around; if it falls out of scope
it can get GCd and cause segfaults.
