As a consequence a plugin system is neither\r\nimplemented nor planned for the future. Instead new features that are decided\r\nto be added will be implemented into the core application. blaplay is written\r\nin Python 2.6, and relies on PyGTK, PyGST, and Mutagen to implement its basic\r\nfunctionality. Notable features include a monitored audio library, automatic\r\ncover art, lyrics and biography fetching, and last.fm scrobbling. In the future\r\nblaplay will also integrate event, artist and release recommendations (powered\r\nby last.fm, musicbrainz and, songkick), as well as support for internet radio\r\nstations and portable media devices. Refer to the TODO file for more details on\r\nplanned features/enhancements.

Building blaplay therefore\r\nrequires a recent version of the Cython compiler (>= 0.15.1), as well as the\r\nsingle-precision library of fftw3 and its development headers. To prepare and\r\nrun blaplay locally, issue\r\n```bash\r\n  $ ./setup.py build_ext --inplace\r\n  $ ./blaplay.py\r\n```\r\nafter satisfying all build-dependencies. To install blaplay system-wide and run\r\nit, simply issue\r\n```bash\r\n  $ ./setup.py install\r\n  $ blaplay\r\n```","google":""}
