{"name":"blaplay","tagline":"Minimalist audio player for GNU/Linux written in Python","body":"blaplay - a bla that plays (or: a working title that stuck)\r\n\r\nblaplay is an audio player for GNU/Linux with a minimalist design approach\r\nrather than feature richness. It is written in Python 2.6, and relies on PyGTK,\r\nPyGST, and Mutagen to implement its core functionality. Notable features\r\ninclude a monitored audio library, automatic cover art, lyrics and biography\r\nfetching, and last.fm scrobbling. In addition to that it offers event and\r\nrelease recommendations based on the user's last.fm library, as well as support\r\nfor internet radio streams.\r\n\r\nRefer to the TODO file for more details on planned features/enhancements, and\r\nthe BUGS file for a description of currently known issues and proposed possible\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nBuild dependencies:\r\n* python-dev (>= 2.6)\r\n* Cython (>= 0.15.1)\r\n* python-numpy\r\n* libfftw3-dev (>= 3.2.2)\r\n\r\nRuntime dependencies:\r\n* python (>= 2.6)\r\n* python-gtk2 (>= 2.21)\r\n* python-gst0.10\r\n* python-mutagen (>= 1.19)\r\n* python-gobject (>= 2.21)\r\n* libfftw3-3 (>= 3.2.2)\r\n\r\nRecommended:\r\n* gstreamer0.10-plugins-good\r\n* gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad\r\n* gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly\r\n* python-mmkeys\r\n* python-dbus (>= 0.83)\r\n\r\nblaplay currently includes visualization elements which, for performance\r\nreasons, are written in Cython, wrapping fftw3 in order to transfer the most\r\ncomputationally expensive operations to C-code. Building blaplay therefore\r\nrequires a recent version of the Cython compiler (>= 0.15.1), as well as the\r\nsingle-precision library of fftw3 and its development headers. To prepare and\r\nrun blaplay locally, issue\r\n```bash\r\n  $ ./setup.py build_ext --inplace\r\n  $ ./blaplay.py\r\n```\r\nafter satisfying all build-dependencies. To install blaplay system-wide and run\r\nit, simply issue\r\n```bash\r\n  $ ./setup.py install\r\n  $ blaplay\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
